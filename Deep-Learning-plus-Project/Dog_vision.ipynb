        "   The data we're using is from [Kaggle's dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data)\n",
        "## 3. Evaluation\n",

        "It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification (one thing versus another).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the most important step in a deep learng problem is getting the data ready (turning it into numbers), that's what we're going to start with.\n",

        "1. Get data ready (download from Kaggle, store, import).\n",
        "2. Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).\n",
        "3. Choose and fit/train a model ([TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), `tf.keras.applications`, [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [EarlyStopping](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping)).\n",
        "4. Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).\n",
        "5. Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 images, make sure it works, increase the number of images).\n",
        "6. Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results).\n",
        "\n",
        "For preprocessing our data, we're going to use TensorFlow 2.x. The whole premise here is to get our data into Tensors (arrays of numbers which can be run on GPUs) and then allow a machine learning model to find patterns between them.\n",
