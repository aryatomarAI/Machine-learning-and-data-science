So if someone asks you a question about it, you can give them an explanation and when you start building models, you can sound check them to make sure they're not performing too well (**overfitting**) or why they might be performing poorly (**underfitting**).\n",

    "5. How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?\n",
