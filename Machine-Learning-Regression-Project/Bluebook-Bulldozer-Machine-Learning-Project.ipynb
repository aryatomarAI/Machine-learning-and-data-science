    "# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and evaluation metric we'll be using (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques used in here have been inspired and adapted from [the fast.ai machine learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml).\n"
